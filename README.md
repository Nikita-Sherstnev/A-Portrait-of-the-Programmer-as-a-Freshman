# A-Portrait-of-the-Programmer-as-a-Freshman

Multiple simple programs that I wrote in plain C as a freshman at the SSTU, my university. 

Includes:<br>
Sorting algorithms:<br>
Bubble sort<br>
Insertion sort<br>
Shellsort<br>
Quicksort<br>
Counting sort<br>

Graph algorithms:<br>
DFT (Recursive)<br>
DFT (Stack)<br>
BFT (Queue)<br>
Prim's algorithm<br>
Kruskal's algorithm<br>
Dijkstra's algorithm <br>
("One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path.")<br>
Floyd–Warshall algorithm<br>
